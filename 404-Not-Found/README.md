## Overview

![screenshot](C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\前端学习\动手做\404-not-found-master\project-preview.png)

In this project, I try to practice my skills of HTML & CSS. I divide the page into three parts. It is a bit hard for me to create the appropriate className. But after that everything becomes very clear and easy.

To improve the user experience , I choose "padding" property rather than margin or others to expand the click area for the button.
